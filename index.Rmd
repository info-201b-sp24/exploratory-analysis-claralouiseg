warner_bros_movies <- Years %>%
  filter(Distributor == "Warner Bros." & Year >= 1983 & Year <= 2024)
  
warner_movies_per_year <- warner_bros_movies %>% group_by(Year) %>% summarise(n = n())

ggplot(warner_movies_per_year, aes(x = Year, y = n)) +
geom_line(color = 'blue') +
geom_point(color = 'blue') +
